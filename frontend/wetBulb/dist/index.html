        <b><i>35°C Wet Bulb Temperature is extremely dangerous to humans!</i></b>
        <p>Explanation: The wet-bulb temperature is the lowest temperature a thermometer shows that is covered in soaked
       cloth with air passing over it.</p>
       <p>At such it is an ideal indicator of how cool a human can get by sweating. Higher temperature and higher
       relative humidity will cause sweating to become less effective up to a point where the human body can not cool
       down enough through natural ways and the climate becomes harmful.</p>
       <p>This condition is reached at a wet-bulb temperature of 35°C and above.</p>
       <p>This tool uses the <a href="https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/apme/50/11/jamc-d-11-0143.1.xml"
       target="_blank">Stull formula</a> that approximates the wet-bulb temperature well from −20° to 50°C and 5% to 99%
       relative humidity.</p>
